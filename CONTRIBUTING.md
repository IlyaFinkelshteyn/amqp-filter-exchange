## Overview

RabbitMQ projects use pull requests to discuss, collaborate on and accept code contributions.
Pull requests is the primary place of discussing code changes.

## How to Contribute

The process is fairly standard:

 * Fork the repository or repositories you plan on contributing to
 * Clone [RabbitMQ umbrella repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-public-umbrella)
 * `cd umbrella`, `make co`
 * Create a branch with a descriptive name in the relevant repositories
 * Make your changes, run tests, commit with a [descriptive message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), push to your fork
 * Submit pull requests with an explanation what has been changed and **why**
 * Submit a filled out and signed [Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ca#how-to-submit) if needed (see below)
 * Be patient. We will get to your pull request eventually
